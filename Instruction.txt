After cloning the code you should take care of these steps. 

1- you should install the latest version of the .net framework.
2- it will be good if you run it on Visual Studio 2022.
3- you don't need to run any command to create your database before running such as "add migration or update database",
   the project will create your database automatically when you click the run button.
4- After running you should add the employee first to make all apis fretch data.
5- In the employee model, birthdate should follow the DateTime format, 
   it will be like "year-month-day" and should be to number in month and day as "1999-08-05".
6- All APIs will appear in the swager UI so it helps you to know what API want.
